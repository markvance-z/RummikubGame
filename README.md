# RummikubGame

Hello, welcome to me trying to make Rummikub in Java! 

This game is currently set up for 4 players in a local match. Each player has the option to draw a tile, sort their tiles, or go to the next player. I have not implemented any logic or scoring to this game yet, and it is just on the honor system. I am mostly working on getting the gameplay part of it to work, such as playing, drawing, sorting tiles in player hands. The app is a work in progress and needs some serious organizational help. I strayed away from my original plan a lot and it got quite messy. With some more time, I can organize and clean up this code to make it function better and with additional features.

Thank you!
